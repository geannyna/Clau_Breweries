             Welcome to follow the hoppy journey of craft beer nomads! We are Toni and Anne, digital nomads, location independent entrepreneurs and travel bloggers originally from Finland. We have been on the road since summer 2017, traveling and housesitting in Europe and beyond. One of our favourite hobbies when exploring new destinations, is to find local craft beers and to visit artisan breweries or their tap rooms.We are adventurous backpackers, often following the road less traveled. As craft beer enthusiasts, we are interested in the art of brewing and the stories behind micro breweries and their beers. Of all the different beer styles, fruity and bitter India Pale Ales are maybe closest to our hearts, but we have found favorites also among several other beer styles.
